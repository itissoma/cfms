---

## ⚠️ KNOWN ISSUES (TO BE FIXED IN v0.85)

### Navigation Problems Identified:

1. **Landing Page Issues:**
   - Root domain (`chs-stg.cfms.hub.etadvisory.com`) → shows "My Account" instead of "CFMS Dashboard"
   - Home button on dashboard → goes to "My Account" instead of staying on dashboard

2. **User Dropdown Issues:**
   - Shows "My Account", "Log out", "Switch To Desk"
   - Should only show "Log out"

3. **Footer Issues:**
   - Shows email signup form ("Your email address... Get Updates")
   - Shows "Powered by ERPNext"
   - Should be clean or show "© ET Group"

4. **Breadcrumb Navigation Issues:**
   - Clicking "CFMS" in breadcrumb → goes to `/app/cfms` (exposes modules)
   - Clicking "💰 CFMS" logo → goes to `/app/` (ERPNext Desk)
   - Hover dropdown shows base system modules
   - All should redirect to `/cfms-dashboard`

5. **Activity Section (Minor):**
   - Still visible at bottom of forms
   - Shows "Administrator created this", etc.
   - Low priority, acceptable to keep
