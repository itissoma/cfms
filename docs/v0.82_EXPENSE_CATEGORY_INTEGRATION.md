# v0.82 - Expense Category Integration

**Branch:** `expense-category-master`  
**Date:** October 27, 2025  
**Status:** ✅ Complete

---

## 🎯 Overview

Integrated CFMS Expense with Category Master system for dynamic, maintainable categorization. Replaced hardcoded Select fields with Link to Category Master, enabling dynamic subcategory filtering.

---

## ✨ Key Features

### 1. Category Master Integration
- **Before:** Hardcoded Select field with 12 predefined options
- **After:** Link to CFMS Expense Category master
- **Benefit:** Centralized category management, no code changes needed to add/modify categories

### 2. Dynamic Subcategory Filtering
- **Field Type:** Select (dynamically populated via JavaScript)
- **Behavior:** Subcategory options update based on selected category
- **Example:** Select "Travel" → Subcategory shows: Domestic, International, Accommodation, Local Transport

### 3. Data Quality Improvements
- ✅ Both Category and Subcategory are mandatory
- ✅ 100% accurate categorization (no arbitrary defaults)
- ✅ Validation: Project expenses require project name
- ✅ Validation: Non-zero amounts enforced

## 📊 Current Category Structure

**9 Main Categories:**
1. **Payroll** (5 subcategories): Base, Variable Pay, Bonus, Benefits, Other

'Payroll - Base'                              → Payroll         → Base (12 expenses)
'Payroll - Variable Pay, Travel Allowance...' → Payroll         → Variable Pay (1 expense)
'Other'                                       → Other           → Miscellaneous (3 expenses)
```

## 🛠️ Technical Implementation

### Fields Added/Modified

**CFMS Expense DocType:**
- `cfms_exp_category` (Link → CFMS Expense Category) - Changed from Select, Mandatory
- `cfms_exp_subcategory` (Select) - New field, Dynamically populated, Mandatory

### JavaScript Enhancement

**File:** `cfms_expense.js`

**Features:**
- Category change event handler
- Fetches subcategories from Category master via API
- Updates Subcategory dropdown options dynamically
- Auto-selects first subcategory option
- Clears subcategory when category changes

**Key Function:**
```javascript
dialog.fields_dict.cfms_exp_category.$input.on('change', function() {
    // Fetch category subcategories
    // Update subcategory dropdown
    // Auto-select first option
});
```

### Python Logic

**File:** `cfms_expense.py`

**Enhancements:**
- Smart defaults from Category master
- Payment status auto-updates (Pending → Overdue → Paid)
- Validation: Project expenses require project name
- Validation: Non-zero amounts
- Auto-naming with proper prefixes

---

## 🎨 Dashboard Updates

### Changes Made
- **Before:** Separate "Quick Entry" and "Data Entry" sections
- **After:** Unified "Data Entry" and "Data Management" sections
- **Benefit:** Clear semantic structure, consistent UX

### New Structure
1. **⚡ Data Entry** - Create new records (links to /new forms)
2. **📝 Data Management** - View/manage all records (list views)
3. **📊 Reports** - Analysis and insights

---
