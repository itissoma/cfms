# CFMS Dimension Integration - v0.83 Complete Guide

## Overview

The dimension integration feature adds 4 accounting dimensions to CFMS transactions for proper cost allocation and financial reporting. This enables multi-dimensional analysis of expenses and revenues across Department, Location, Cost Center, and Product Line.

---

## Feature Summary

### What Was Added

**4 Dimensions:**
1. **Department** - Link to Department master (15 departments, filtered to 4 relevant)
2. **Location** - Link to Location master (user creates as needed)
3. **Cost Center** - Link to Cost Center master (3 leaf centers: Commercial, Non-Commercial, Overhead)
4. **Product Line** - Link to Item Group master (3 products: Choco, Scylla, Other)

**Added To:**
- CFMS Expense Category (default dimensions for each category)
- CFMS Project (project-level dimension defaults)
- CFMS Expense (transaction-level dimensions with auto-population)
- CFMS Revenue *(Phase 5 - pending)*

---

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Core Masters Setup ✅

**Created/Verified:**
- 3 Cost Centers under root "Corporate Health Solutions Pvt Limited - CHSPL":
  - Commercial - CHSPL
  - Non-Commercial - CHSPL
  - Overhead - CHSPL
- Item Group hierarchy:
  - CFMS Product Line (parent)
    - Choco (child)
    - Scylla (child)
    - Other (child)
- 15 Departments (existing, verified)
- Locations (existing, no changes)

**Files:**
- `scripts/setup/claude_setup_core_masters.py` (reference)

---

### Phase 2: Expense Category Dimensions ✅

**Added Fields to CFMS Expense Category:**
```
cfms_expcat_default_department    (Link → Department)
cfms_expcat_default_location      (Link → Location)
cfms_expcat_default_cost_center   (Link → Cost Center)
cfms_expcat_product_line          (Link → Item Group)
```

**Populated Defaults for 9 Categories:**

| Category | Department | Cost Center |
|----------|-----------|-------------|
| Payroll | Research & Development | Commercial - CHSPL |
| Office | Administration - CHSPL | Overhead - CHSPL |
| Travel | _(blank)_ | Overhead - CHSPL |
| Marketing | _(blank)_ | Commercial - CHSPL |
| GRC | Administration - CHSPL | Overhead - CHSPL |
| Professional Services | _(blank)_ | Overhead - CHSPL |
| Financial | Operations | Commercial - CHSPL |
| Taxes | Administration - CHSPL | Overhead - CHSPL |
| Other | _(blank)_ | _(blank)_ |

**Files:**
- `cfms/cfms/doctype/cfms_expense_category/cfms_expense_category.json`
- `scripts/setup/cfms_populate_category_defaults.py`

**Usage:**
```python
# Run in Frappe console to populate category defaults
exec(open('apps/cfms/scripts/setup/cfms_populate_category_defaults.py').read())
populate_category_defaults()
```

---

### Phase 3: Project Dimensions ✅

**Added Fields to CFMS Project:**
```
cfms_prj_section_dimensions    (Section Break)
cfms_prj_department           (Link → Department)
cfms_prj_location             (Link → Location)
cfms_prj_cost_center          (Link → Cost Center)
cfms_prj_product_line         (Link → Item Group)
```

**Link Filters Applied:**

**Department Filter:**
```json
[["Department", "name", "in", ["Administration - CHSPL", "Research & Development", "Operations", "Sales"]]]
```
*Shows only 4 relevant departments out of 15*

**Cost Center Filter:**
```json
[["Cost Center", "name", "in", ["Commercial - CHSPL", "Non-Commercial - CHSPL", "Overhead - CHSPL"]]]
```
*Shows only leaf cost centers, excludes parent*

**Product Line Filter:**
```json
[["Item Group", "parent_item_group", "=", "CFMS Product Line"]]
```
*Shows only: Choco, Scylla, Other*

**Files:**
- `cfms/cfms/doctype/cfms_project/cfms_project.json`
- `docs/frappe_filter_syntax_guide.md` (comprehensive filter documentation)

---

### Phase 4: Expense Dimensions + Auto-Population ✅

**Added Fields to CFMS Expense:**
```
cfms_exp_section_dimensions    (Section Break - Row 11)
cfms_exp_department           (Link → Department - Row 12)
cfms_exp_location             (Link → Location - Row 13)
cfms_exp_cost_center          (Link → Cost Center - Row 14)
cfms_exp_product_line         (Link → Item Group - Row 15)
```

**Same Link Filters as Project** (see Phase 3)

**Auto-Population Logic:**

```python
Priority Order:
1. Project Expenses → Fetch from Project master (cfms_prj_* fields)
2. Any Expense with Category → Fetch from Category defaults (cfms_expcat_* fields)
3. User Manual Entry → Always takes precedence (no override)
```

**Implementation:**
- `populate_dimensions_from_project()` - Runs first for Project expenses
- `populate_dimensions_from_category()` - Runs second for all expenses with category
- Both check if field is empty before populating (respects user input)

**Files:**
- `cfms/cfms/doctype/cfms_expense/cfms_expense.json`
- `cfms/cfms/doctype/cfms_expense/cfms_expense.py`

---

### Phase 5: Revenue Dimensions ✅

**Added Fields to CFMS Revenue:**
```
cfms_rev_section_dimensions    (Section Break - Row 15 - "Profit Allocation Dimensions")
cfms_rev_department           (Link → Department - Row 16)
cfms_rev_location             (Link → Location - Row 17)
cfms_rev_cost_center          (Link → Cost Center - Row 18)
cfms_rev_product_line         (Link → Item Group - Row 19)
```

**Same Link Filters as Project/Expense** (see Phase 3)

**Auto-Population Logic:**
```python
def populate_dimensions_from_project():
    # Only for Project revenue
    # Fetches from Project master (cfms_prj_* fields)
    # Only if dimension field is empty (user can override)
```

**Implementation:**
- Simpler than Expense (only 1 source: Project master)
- No category defaults (Revenue has no categories)
- ~60 lines of code vs ~140 for Expense
- Same error handling pattern

**Files:**
- `cfms/cfms/doctype/cfms_revenue/cfms_revenue.json`
- `cfms/cfms/doctype/cfms_revenue/cfms_revenue.py`

**Section Naming:**
- Used "Profit Allocation Dimensions" (vs "Cost Allocation" for expenses)
- More appropriate terminology for revenue context

---

## Technical Implementation

### Field Naming Convention

**Pattern:** `{doctype_prefix}_{field_purpose}`

**Examples:**
- Expense: `cfms_exp_department`, `cfms_exp_cost_center`
- Project: `cfms_prj_department`, `cfms_prj_cost_center`
- Category: `cfms_expcat_default_department`, `cfms_expcat_default_cost_center`
- Revenue: `cfms_rev_department`, `cfms_rev_cost_center`

### Python Auto-Population Pattern

```python
def before_save(self):
    """Auto-populate dimensions"""
    # Priority 1: From related master (Project)
    self.populate_dimensions_from_project()
    
    # Priority 2: From category defaults
    self.populate_dimensions_from_category()

def populate_dimensions_from_project(self):
    """Fetch from project if Project expense"""
    if self.cfms_exp_expense_type != 'Project':
        return
    
    try:
        project = frappe.get_doc('CFMS Project', self.cfms_exp_project_name)
        
        # Only populate if field is empty (user can override)
        if not self.cfms_exp_department and project.cfms_prj_department:
            self.cfms_exp_department = project.cfms_prj_department
        
        # ... repeat for other dimensions
    except Exception as e:
        frappe.log_error(...)  # Log but don't block save

def populate_dimensions_from_category(self):
    """Fetch from category defaults"""
    if not self.cfms_exp_category:
        return
    
    try:
        category = frappe.get_doc('CFMS Expense Category', self.cfms_exp_category)
        
        # Only populate if field is empty
        if not self.cfms_exp_department and category.cfms_expcat_default_department:
            self.cfms_exp_department = category.cfms_expcat_default_department
        
        # ... repeat for other dimensions
    except Exception as e:
        frappe.log_error(...)  # Log but don't block save
```

### Link Filters Pattern

**Frappe Filter Syntax:**
```json
[["DocType", "field", "operator", "value"]]
```

**Examples:**
```json
// Single value equality
[["Item Group", "parent_item_group", "=", "CFMS Product Line"]]

// Multiple values (IN operator)
[["Department", "name", "in", ["Sales", "Operations", "Admin"]]]

// Comparison operators
[["Cost Center", "is_group", "=", 0]]
```

**Reference:** See `docs/frappe_filter_syntax_guide.md` for comprehensive guide.

## User Workflows

### Workflow 1: Creating Project Expense

```
1. User opens CFMS Expense form
2. Selects Expense Type = "Project"
3. Selects Project Name = "PRJ-2510-PRJ-0001"
4. Selects Category = "Travel"
5. Dimensions auto-populate from Project:
   - Department: Operations
   - Cost Center: Commercial - CHSPL
   - Product Line: Choco
6. User can override any dimension if needed
7. Saves expense
```

### Workflow 2: Creating Overhead Expense

```
1. User opens CFMS Expense form
2. Selects Expense Type = "Overhead"
3. Selects Category = "Payroll"
4. Dimensions auto-populate from Category:
   - Department: Research & Development
   - Cost Center: Commercial - CHSPL
5. User can override any dimension if needed
6. Saves expense
```

### Workflow 3: Manual Dimension Entry

```
1. User opens CFMS Expense form
2. Manually selects Department = "Sales"
3. Selects Category (which has default Department)
4. System respects user's manual selection
5. Department remains "Sales" (not overridden)
```

- No auto-population (expected behavior)

---

## Data Migration

### Existing Expenses

Existing expenses (16 records as of v0.82) will NOT have dimensions auto-populated until they are re-saved. Options:

**Option A: Manual Update (Recommended)**
- Users update dimensions when editing existing expenses
- Gradual, controlled migration

**Option B: Bulk Update Script**
```python
# Run in Frappe console
expenses = frappe.get_all('CFMS Expense', filters={'docstatus': 0})
for exp_name in expenses:
    exp = frappe.get_doc('CFMS Expense', exp_name['name'])
    exp.save()  # Triggers auto-population
frappe.db.commit()
```

---

## Reporting Benefits

### Multi-Dimensional Analysis

With dimensions, users can now analyze expenses by:

**Single Dimension:**
- Department-wise expense report
- Cost Center-wise expense report
- Product Line-wise expense report
- Location-wise expense report

**Multi-Dimensional:**
- Department + Product Line (e.g., R&D spending on Choco vs Scylla)
- Cost Center + Category (e.g., Commercial vs Overhead by expense type)
- Location + Department (e.g., HQ vs Bangalore by department)

### ERPNext Integration

Dimensions enable integration with ERPNext's standard reports:
- Budget vs Actual by Cost Center
- Profitability Analysis by Product Line
- Department-wise P&L
- Location-wise financial statements

---

## Troubleshooting

### Dimensions Not Auto-Populating

**Check:**
1. ✅ Is the expense a Project expense? (auto-populates from project)
2. ✅ Is a category selected? (auto-populates from category)
3. ✅ Does the project/category have dimension defaults set?
4. ✅ Are the dimension fields empty? (won't override user input)

**Debug:**
```python
# In Frappe console
exp = frappe.get_doc('CFMS Expense', 'EXP-2510-PRJ-0001')
print(f"Type: {exp.cfms_exp_expense_type}")
print(f"Project: {exp.cfms_exp_project_name}")
print(f"Category: {exp.cfms_exp_category}")

if exp.cfms_exp_project_name:
    project = frappe.get_doc('CFMS Project', exp.cfms_exp_project_name)
    print(f"Project Dept: {project.cfms_prj_department}")
```

---

### Link Filters Not Working

**Check:**
1. ✅ Syntax: `[["DocType", "field", "operator", "value"]]`
2. ✅ Field names match exactly (case-sensitive)
3. ✅ Values exist in target DocType
4. ✅ No typos in JSON

**Test Filter:**
```python
# In Frappe console
result = frappe.get_all('Item Group',
    filters=[['Item Group', 'parent_item_group', '=', 'CFMS Product Line']],
    fields=['name'])
print(result)
# Should return: [{'name': 'Choco'}, {'name': 'Scylla'}, {'name': 'Other'}]
```

## Future Enhancements

### Planned (Beyond v0.83)

1. **Revenue Dimensions (Phase 5)** - Add dimensions to CFMS Revenue
2. **Dimension-based Reports** - Custom reports using dimensions
3. **Dimension Validation** - Mandatory dimension rules by expense type
4. **Budget Integration** - Link budgets to dimensions
5. **Dashboard Widgets** - Dimension-based KPI widgets

### Potential Enhancements

- **Default Location** - Auto-detect from user profile
- **Dimension Templates** - Save dimension combinations as templates
- **Bulk Dimension Update** - Update dimensions for multiple expenses at once
- **Dimension Analytics** - AI-powered dimension suggestions
- **Approval Workflows** - Route by dimension (e.g., high-value overhead to CFO)
