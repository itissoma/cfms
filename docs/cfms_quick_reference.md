## üéØ HOW TO START A NEW THREAD

### Scenario 1: Implement Specific Phase

**What You Say:**
> "Let's implement Phase 1 navigation fixes from the master TODO list"

**What Claude Does:**
```
1. Calls project_knowledge_search with query: "Phase 1 navigation TODO"
2. Finds master TODO list
3. Reads Phase 1 scope (TODO-001 through TODO-010)
4. Proceeds with implementation
```

**Result:** Claude has full context of what Phase 1 means ‚úÖ

---

### Scenario 2: Need Technical Details

**What You Say:**
> "How do we fix the landing page issue? Check the feasibility analysis"

**What Claude Does:**
```
1. Calls project_knowledge_search with query: "landing page feasibility"
2. Finds feasibility analysis document
3. Reads the 3 technical approaches
4. Recommends best approach
```

**Result:** Claude provides detailed technical guidance ‚úÖ

---

### Scenario 3: Check Current System Status

**What You Say:**
> "What's the current status of CFMS? What's working and what's broken?"

**What Claude Does:**
```
1. Calls project_knowledge_search with query: "v0.84 status current"
2. Finds v0.84 summary document
3. Reviews what's working and known issues
4. Provides current state overview
```

**Result:** Claude understands the current system ‚úÖ

---

### Scenario 4: Continue Previous Work

**What You Say:**
> "Let's continue working on the breadcrumb navigation fix from last time"

**What Claude Does:**
```
1. Calls project_knowledge_search with query: "breadcrumb navigation fix TODO"
2. Finds TODO-008, TODO-009, TODO-010
3. Checks feasibility analysis for implementation approach
4. Continues where previous thread left off
```

**Result:** Seamless continuation ‚úÖ

3. Review v0.84 status to understand current state
4. Propose implementation plan

Ready to code!
```

### Template C: Debug or Check Status

```
Hi Claude! I need to understand the current state of CFMS.

Please:
1. Search for v0.84 status in project knowledge

## üéì TIPS FOR SUCCESS

### DO:
- ‚úÖ Reference specific phase numbers (Phase 1, 2, 3)
- ‚úÖ Mention TODO numbers when you know them
- ‚úÖ Ask Claude to "check project knowledge" or "search the TODO list"
- ‚úÖ Be specific about what you're trying to accomplish
- ‚úÖ Mention version numbers (v0.84, v0.85) for context

### DON'T:
- ‚ùå Assume Claude remembers previous conversations
- ‚ùå Say "as we discussed last time" without context
- ‚ùå Reference things not in project documentation
- ‚ùå Expect Claude to know about changes made outside documented work

## üîç SEARCH EXAMPLES

### Example 1: Starting Phase 1
**User:** "Let's implement Phase 1 from the TODO list"  
**Claude Searches:** `project_knowledge_search("Phase 1 navigation TODO")`  
**Finds:** Master TODO list, Phase 1 section  
**Result:** ‚úÖ Full context

### Example 2: Technical Details
**User:** "How do we fix breadcrumb navigation? Check the feasibility doc"  
**Claude Searches:** `project_knowledge_search("breadcrumb navigation feasibility")`  
**Finds:** Feasibility analysis, section 1.4  
**Result:** ‚úÖ Technical approaches with code examples

### Example 3: Current Status
**User:** "What's broken right now?"  
**Claude Searches:** `project_knowledge_search("v0.84 known issues")`  
**Finds:** v0.84 summary, known issues section  
**Result:** ‚úÖ Complete list of issues

### Example 4: Multi-Document Search
**User:** "Let's work on TODO-006 footer cleanup - show me the plan and how to implement it"  
**Claude Searches:**  
1. `project_knowledge_search("TODO-006 footer")`  
2. `project_knowledge_search("footer cleanup feasibility")`  
**Finds:** TODO details + technical approach  
**Result:** ‚úÖ Complete implementation plan

## üö® WHAT IF SEARCH FAILS?

### If Claude Can't Find Documentation:

**Possible Reasons:**
1. Documentation not yet added to project (need to move from outputs)
2. Search terms too specific or too vague
3. Information truly doesn't exist yet

**What To Do:**
1. Try broader search terms
2. Ask Claude to search for "master TODO" or "v0.84 status"
3. Provide the information directly in the new thread
4. Create new documentation if needed

## üéØ REAL-WORLD USAGE EXAMPLES

### Example 1: Monday Morning, New Week

**User:** "Hi Claude! Let's pick up where we left off. Can you check what phase we're on and what's next?"

**Claude:**
```
[Searches project knowledge for "current status phase"]
[Finds v0.84 summary]

"We're at v0.84. Phase 1 navigation fixes are planned next (v0.85).
Specifically, we need to:
- Fix landing page redirect (TODO-001)
- Clean up user dropdown (TODO-004/005)
- Remove footer elements (TODO-006/007)
- Fix breadcrumb navigation (TODO-008/009/010)

Ready to start with the landing page fix?"
```

---

### Example 2: Specific Feature Request

**User:** "I want to add the approval workflow we discussed. Can you find the plan?"

**Claude:**
```
[Searches project knowledge for "Phase 2 workflow approval"]
[Finds master TODO and feasibility analysis]

"Found it! Phase 2 covers the approval workflow (TODO-011 through TODO-019).
The plan uses Frappe's built-in Workflow engine.

Key points:
- States: Draft ‚Üí Pending ‚Üí Approved/Rejected/Hold
- Email notifications automatic
- Estimated effort: 1-2 days
- Low risk (native feature)

Should we start with the workflow design (TODO-011)?"
```

---

### Example 3: Technical Question

**User:** "What's the best way to implement the landing page redirect?"

**Claude:**
```
[Searches project knowledge for "landing page feasibility"]
[Finds 3 approaches in feasibility analysis]

"The feasibility analysis shows 3 approaches:

1. Role-Based (10 min, very low risk) - RECOMMENDED
2. JavaScript Redirect (15 min, low risk) - BACKUP
3. Python Hook (30 min, low risk) - MOST ROBUST

Recommendation: Use #1 + #2 (defense in depth).
Should I proceed with implementation?"
```

## ‚úÖ SUCCESS CHECKLIST

Before starting a new thread, make sure:
- [ ] I know which phase I want to work on
- [ ] I have specific goals (or will ask Claude to find them)
- [ ] I understand Claude will need to search project knowledge
- [ ] I'm ready to reference TODO numbers or phase names
- [ ] I won't expect Claude to "remember" previous conversations

**If all checked:** You're ready for a successful new thread! üöÄ

## üåü SUMMARY

**Key Takeaway:** Claude can access project documentation through `project_knowledge_search`, but YOU need to prompt it.

**Magic Words:**
- "Check the master TODO list"
- "Search project knowledge for [topic]"
- "Find Phase [X] in the documentation"
- "What does the feasibility analysis say about [feature]?"
- "What's the current status according to v0.84?"

**With These Phrases:** Claude will retrieve full context and continue work seamlessly!
