**Features:**

**Changes:**
- **Expense Form:** 3 collapsible sections

## ⚠️ KNOWN ISSUES (Acceptable)

These are minor issues that will be addressed in v0.85 (Phase 1):

   - Root domain still shows "My Account" instead of "CFMS Dashboard"
   - Home button goes to wrong place

2. **User Dropdown:**
   - Shows "My Account", "Switch To Desk" (should only show "Log out")

3. **Footer:**
   - Email signup form still visible
   - "Powered by ERPNext" text present

4. **Breadcrumb Navigation:**
   - Clicking "CFMS" in breadcrumb goes to `/app/cfms`
   - Clicking logo goes to `/app/`
   - Exposes ERPNext modules

5. **Activity Section (Very Minor):**
   - Still visible at bottom of forms
   - Shows "Administrator created this", etc.
