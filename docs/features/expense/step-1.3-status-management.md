# Step 1.3: Status Auto-Management

## 🎯 Goal
Automatically update Expense Status based on payment dates.

## 🚀 Deployment
Modified: `cfms_expense.py`

Added `update_payment_status()` method that:
- Sets status to "Paid" when Actual Payment Date is set
- Sets status to "Overdue" when Payment Due Date passes

## ✅ Verification
- Set Actual Payment Date → Status becomes "Paid"
- Set Due Date to past → Status becomes "Overdue"
